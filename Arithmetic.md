| Op | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `sha256` | SHA256 hash of value X, yields [32]byte |
| `keccak256` | Keccak256 hash of value X, yields [32]byte |
| `sha512_256` | SHA512_256 hash of value X, yields [32]byte |
| `ed25519verify` | for (data A, signature B, pubkey C) verify the signature of ("ProgData" \|\| program_hash \|\| data) against the pubkey => {0 or 1} |
| `+` | A plus B. Panic on overflow. |
| `-` | A minus B. Panic if B > A. |
| `/` | A divided by B. Panic if B == 0. |
| `*` | A times B. Panic on overflow. |
| `<` | A less than B => {0 or 1} |
| `>` | A greater than B => {0 or 1} |
| `<=` | A less than or equal to B => {0 or 1} |
| `>=` | A greater than or equal to B => {0 or 1} |
| `&&` | A is not zero and B is not zero => {0 or 1} |
| `\|\|` | A is not zero or B is not zero => {0 or 1} |
| `==` | A is equal to B => {0 or 1} |
| `!=` | A is not equal to B => {0 or 1} |
| `!` | X == 0 yields 1; else 0 |
| `len` | yields length of byte value X |
| `itob` | converts uint64 X to big endian bytes |
| `btoi` | converts bytes X as big endian to uint64 |
| `%` | A modulo B. Panic if B == 0. |
| `\|` | A bitwise-or B |
| `&` | A bitwise-and B |
| `^` | A bitwise-xor B |
| `~` | bitwise invert value X |
| `mulw` | A times B out to 128-bit long result as low (top) and high uint64 values on the stack |
